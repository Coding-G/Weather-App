# Weather-App
This is a simple yet wonderful weather app. It was created using OpenWeather's API, that I signed up to. The code itself isn't that long, but for me, it was complicated. To be honest, themost complicated parts were just how the syntax works for pulling in images from online. One extra thing I did was changing the background imag based on the time of day. This is the first time i did this. Please vote for me. Thanks!
